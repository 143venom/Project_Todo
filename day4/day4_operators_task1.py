# Arithmetic Operators:

x = 20
y = 5

# Addition
addition = x + y
print(addition)
# 20+5 = 25

# Subtraction
subtraction = x - y
print(subtraction)
# 20-5=15

# Multiplication
multiply = x * y  
print(multiply)
# 20*5 = 100

# Division
division = x / y 
print(division) 
# 20 / 5 = 4.0 (floating-point division)

# floor division
floor_division = x // y  
print(floor_division)
# 20 // 5 = 4

# Modulo (Remainder)
modulo = x % y 
print(modulo) 
# 20 % 5 = 0

# Exponentiation
exponentiation = x ** y  
print(exponentiation)
# 20 ** 5 = 3200000


# Assignment Operators:
z = 10
a = 12

# Add and assign
z += a  
print(z)
# Equivalent to z = z + a

# Subtract and assign
z -= a 
print(z) 
# Equivalent to z = z - a

# Multiply and assign
z *= a 
print(z) 
# Equivalent to z = z * a

# Divide and assign
z /= a 
print(z)
# Equivalent to z = z / a

# Modulo and assign
z %= a  
print(z)
# Equivalent to z = z % a

# Exponentiation and assign
z **= a 
print(z) 
# Equivalent to z = z ** a
